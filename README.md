# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard

### Project Overview
🖋️
This project aims to create a Coffee Shop Sales Analysis Dashboard using Microsoft   Excel. The dashboard analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) of sales and customer behavior using pivot tables, charts, and graphs. The data is manipulated and transformed using Excel's Query Editor for cleaning purposes before creating pivot tables and visualizations.

🖋️The goal of the analysis is to provide actionable insights into customer trends, sales by product categories, store performance, and order behavior based on size, day, and time. 

This dashboard assists in understanding business performance and identifying areas for growth and improvement.
